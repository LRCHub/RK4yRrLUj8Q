Endless summer
Endless summer

It feels like paradise
The world is closing in
It feels so right
I start to fantasize
About what we getting in
'Cause now you're mine
This is our time

It's an endless summer
Boy I want you close to me
In an endless summer
We'll make love and we'll be free

It's an endless summer
Boy I want you close to me
In an endless summer
Now it's time for you and me

Endless summer

My heart beats stronger now
Now you're by my side
I hold you tight
Please let me show you how
We'll grab a ray of light
'Cause now you're mine
This is our time

Endless summer
Boy I want you close to me
In an endless summer
We'll make love and we'll be free

It's an endless summer
Boy I want you close to me
In an endless summer
Now it's time for you and me

Endless summer
